# leebounds
This package provides various methods to construct bounds on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in the presence of endogeneous selection into the sample. 


# Installation
```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools) 
install_github("vsemenova/leebounds")
library(leebounds)
```
# Example
```
# compute basic Lee (2009) bounds for ATE in week 208
leedata=data.frame(treat=JobCorps_baseline$TREATMNT.y,selection=JobCorps_employment$week_208,outcome=JobCorps_wages$week_208)
leebounds(leedata)
```
