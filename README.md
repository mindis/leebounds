# leebounds
This package provides various methods to construct bounds on the Average Treatment Effect in the presence of endogeneous selection. 


# Installation
```
install.packages("leebounds")
library(leebounds) 
## this is crucial step instead of standard install_github("vsemenova/leebounds"). The packages contains files > 50Mb, which throws warnings. Using remotes::install_github("vsemenova/leebounds", build = FALSE) ensures correct installation of the package. 
remotes::install_github("vsemenova/leebounds", build = FALSE)
library(leebounds)
```
